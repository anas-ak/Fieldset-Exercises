    <h2>Fieldset Exercises</h2>
    
    <p>There are some elements in HTML that rarely get used as both 
    <br>their default appearance and functionality are less needed in 
    <br>modern web designs.
    </p>

    <p>One such element is the &lt;fieldset&gt; element,  
    <br>along with its child element &lt;legend&gt;.
    </p>

    <p>A &lt;fieldset&gt; element is traditionally used to group and 
    <br> access form controls. We can visually notice the 
    <br> grouping by the presence of a border around the 
    <br> grouped content on the screen.
    </p>

    <p>The caption for this group is given inside the 
    <br> &lt;legend&gt; element, that's added as the first child 
    <br> of the &lt;fieldset&gt;
    </p>

    <fieldset id="example">
        <legend>Login</legend>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Username</td>
                <td><input type="text"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Password</td>
                <td><input type="password" name="password" id="password"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </fieldset>

    
    <p>This combination of &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; 
    <br> creates a unique ready-made 'text in border' design where 
    <br> the caption is placed right where the border is and the 
    <br> line of the border doesn't go through the text. The border line 
    <br> 'breaks' when it encounters the beginning of the caption text
    <br> and resume after the text ends.
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>In this post, we'll make use of the&lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; combo 
    <br> to create a more modern border text design that's quick and 
    <br> easy to code and update.
    </p>

    <p>For the four borders, we need four &lt;fieldset&gt; elements, 
    <br>each containiing a &lt;legend&gt; element inside. We add the text 
    <br> that will appear at the borders inside the &lt;legend&gt; elements.
    </p>

    <p>To begin, we stack the &lt;fieldset&gt; elements on top of each other 
    <br> in a grid cell and give them borders. You can stack them 
    <br> using any way you want - it doesn't necessarily have to be a 
    <br> grid.
    </p>

    <fieldset id='example2'><legend>Wash Your Hands</legend></fieldset>
    <fieldset id='example2'><legend>Stay Apart</legend></fieldset>
    <fieldset id='example2'><legend>Wear A Mask</legend></fieldset>
    <fieldset id='example2'><legend>Stay Home</legend></fieldset>

    <p>Only the top border of each &lt;fieldset&gt; element is kept visible 
    <br>while the remaining edges are transparent since the text of the 
    <br> &lt;legend&gt; element appears at the top border of the fieldset by default.
    </p>

    <p>Also, we give all the &lt;fieldset&gt; elements a box-sizing property 
    <br>with a value of border-box so the width and height of the &lt;fieldset&gt; elements 
    <br> include their border and padding sizes too. 
    <br> Doing this later creates a leveled design, when we style the &lt;legend&gt; element.
    </p>

    <p>After this, we rotate the last three &lt;fieldset&gt; elements in 
    <br> order to use their top borders as the side and bottom borders of our design.
    </p>

    <p>Next up is styling the &lt;legend&gt; element. The key to create 
    <br>smooth border text is to give it a zero (or small enough) line height.
    <br>If it has a large line height, that will displace the position of the border it's in, 
    <br> pushing the border down. And when the border moves with the line height
    <br>we won't be able to connect all the four sides of our design and will need 
    <br> to readjust the borders.
    </p>

    <p>The &lt;legend&gt; element that adds the text at the bottom border of our design
    <br> fieldset:nth-of-type(3)>legend is upside-down, because of its rotated 
    <br>&lt;fieldset&gt; parent element. Flip that &lt;legend&gt; element vertically to show 
    <br> its text right-side-up.
    </p>

    <p>Add an image to the first fieldset element and you get something like this</p>
    <p><a href="trial2.html">Result</a> and <a href="trial3.html">this</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Lateral margins can move the text along the border. Left and 
    <br> right margins with auto values will center the text, as seen above. Only the 
    <br> left margin with an auto value will flush the text to the right, and vice versa, 
    <br> for the right margin.
